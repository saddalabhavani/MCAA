 A computer network is a system of interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources. These devices, including computers, servers, and printers, communicate using wired or wireless connections and standardized protocols. Networks enable various functionalities like file sharing, email, and internet access. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Key Concepts:
Interconnection:
Devices are linked together, allowing them to communicate and exchange information. 
Resource Sharing:
Networks facilitate the sharing of hardware (like printers), software, and data between connected devices. 
Communication Protocols:
These are sets of rules that govern how devices communicate, ensuring data is transmitted and received correctly. 
Types of Networks:
Networks can vary in size and scope, from small local networks (LANs) to large, geographically dispersed networks (WANs), including the internet. 
Examples of Network Applications:
Email: Sending and receiving electronic messages.
File Sharing: Transferring files between computers.
Internet Access: Connecting to the vast network of networks for information and services.
Shared Resources: Accessing a centralized database or printer from multiple devices.
Cloud Computing: Utilizing remote servers for storage and processing. 
Benefits of Computer Networks: 
Increased Efficiency: Sharing resources and data streamlines workflows and reduces redundancy. 
Improved Communication: Networks facilitate quick and easy communication between users. 
Enhanced Collaboration: Teams can work together more effectively on shared projects and documents. 
Cost Savings: Sharing resources like printers and software can reduce overall costs. 
Centralized Management: Network administrators can manage and maintain resources from a central location.
